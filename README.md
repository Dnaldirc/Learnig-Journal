### Growth Mindset 

The growth mindset is the idea that intelligence is not determined by a "base IQ" but by ones willingness to learn 

Talking about the growth mindset reminds me of aquote from an old movie -Mewtwo
>“*I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.*”


Here are some of the points on the growth mindset

-Challenges help growth

-Learn from mistakes

-Be inspired by others not threatened

-Never give up

-feedback is contructive

-Anything can be learned
